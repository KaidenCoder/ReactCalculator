## My process

First, I made the input eval function work which evaluates the digits with JSX. Then I started designing the app with Vanilla CSS.

### Built with

- JSX
- CSS
- React JS

### What I learned

I learn how to concatenate string values using react hooks.

```js
const handleDigits = (val) => {
  setValue(value + val);
};
```
